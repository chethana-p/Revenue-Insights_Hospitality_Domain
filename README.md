Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands is a well-established hospitality company that owns multiple five-star hotels across India. The company has been in the industry for the past 20 years and is known for its luxury and business hotels. In recent times, AtliQ Grands has faced a decline in its market share and revenue due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making in management. To tackle this issue, the managing director of AtliQ Grands has decided to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain its market share and revenue. However, the company does not have an in-house data analytics team to provide insights from its historical data. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Recommendations
Dynamic Pricing is the opportunity. Hotels should use the different pricing on weekend and weekday to increase the revenue.
Hotels should adapt to supply and demand concept to increase Revpar and ADR.
First, Atliq have to pick the hotel that is performing the least and itâ€™s the biggest problem statement . If they solve problems in such hotels its overall business goes up.
Online presence is very important and we can increase the occupancy rate if we maintain the good average rating, above 4 considered as good.
In online channels its evident that the probability of booking the hotel room is higher when there is the high average rating. Hotels should work on maintaining good average rating in their booking platforms.
Give promotions or discounts in booking platforms. If hotels increase the occupancy % , their revenue goes up.
Booking Platforms should have user friendly rules and cancellation policies.
Pricing Influeces the occupancy % and vice versa.
Hotels should provide the good customer service. They should work on the customer review.
Get feedbacks from the customers and solve the problems they are facing.
Limitations

Analysis is based on the historical data and this may be not true in future.
